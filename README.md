- Mage_Core
- Mage_Pdf
- Mage_Sales

Compatibility
-------------
- Magento >= 1.6

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1. Install the extension via Magento Connect with the key shown above or copy all the files into your document root.
2. Clear the cache, logout from the admin panel and then login again.
3. Configure the extension under System - Configuration - Sales - PDF Print-outs.

###Recommendation
If you use this extension for an austrian shop or Austrian locale (de_AT), please make sure to install [Hackathon_LocaleFallback](https://github.com/magento-hackathon/Hackathon_LocaleFallback) as well, because we only maintain the strings which differ between German locales, so you need this plugin (or have to copy all the strings over). 

Uninstallation
--------------
1. Remove all extension files from your Magento installation.
